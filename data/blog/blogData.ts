From 2018 to 2025, younger women have gradually moved from conservative all-black Abayas to more colorful, body-conscious, and fashion-forward styles. Fabrics like “Ankara” have seen a massive revival, tailored into fashionable gowns, skirts, and jumpsuits. Even traditional wedding attire, such as the “Kampala” or “George wrapper”, is now fused with lace and sequins for a contemporary appeal.
Modern northern women also incorporate stylish hijabs, turbans, and modest fashion brands into their wardrobes, giving rise to a powerful *modest fashion movement*. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have played a crucial role in spreading these trends across states like Kaduna, Kano, Gombe, and Maiduguri.`,

Between 2018 and 2025, fashion designers and tailors have evolved from basic sewing services to full-fledged fashion entrepreneurs. They now offer custom fittings, bridal services, online bookings, and even fashion training academies.
Technology has played a vital role — fashion houses use mobile apps, WhatsApp, and social media to showcase their work, interact with clients, and market their designs. Local fashion events, like Kano Fashion Week and Arewa Fashion Show, have become platforms to showcase indigenous creativity to a global audience.`,

Designers now create Abayas, Hijabs, and long dresses in luxurious fabrics, bright colors, and flattering cuts — a trend that has gained both local and international attention.`,

Additionally, global inflation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) disrupted fashion events, supply chains, and consumer purchasing power. However, many fashion entrepreneurs have shown resilience by adapting to online platforms and simplifying their production methods.`,
